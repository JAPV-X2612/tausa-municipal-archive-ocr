"""
RAG retrieval module for the Tausa Municipal Archive.

Provides semantic search over transcribed documents using ChromaDB as the
local vector store. Enables the product owner to query the archive and receive
answers with precise book and page citations.

This module is intentionally left as a placeholder pending completion of the
transcription pipeline. Implementation will follow once the JSON transcription
corpus is available.
